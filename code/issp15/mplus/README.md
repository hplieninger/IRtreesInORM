# Mplus files

- The files ending with `01` pertain to the multiple-group models for 11 countries.
- The files ending with `11` pertain to the models for Venezuela.
- The files ending with `21` pertain to the models for Slovenia.
- The data are stored in file `mplus-tree-mcn-01.txt`.
- The data for the improper MCN2 model (also sometimes called APP model) are stored in the file `mplus-improper-app-01.txt`.
  This data should not be used for substantive research questions, because the pseudo-items do not pertain to a valid model. They are used for illustrative purposes alone.
